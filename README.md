# Getting Started

After cloning and `cd`ing into the repository:

```bash
./Game.py
```

There are failing tests which have been commented out for your convenience. Modify the source code without modifying the tests such that all tests pass.

NOTE: We care more about thoughtful and careful changes than fixing all of the bugs as fast as possible.
